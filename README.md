# Pokedex

Using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

- `react`
    * Functional components, stateless components (isolate state management)
    * hooks (useEffect, useState)
- `redux` to manage status using actions (indicates what to do) and reducers (update state)
- `redux-observable` it is a middleware for redux, for managing side effects using `epics` (takes a stream of all actions dispatched and return a stream of new actions to dispatch)
- `redux-arc` to avoid DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
- `material-ui` as component libary :')
